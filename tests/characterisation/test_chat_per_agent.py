"""Item 2 -- POST /api/chat, per agent, via explicit selection.

Asserts the response KEY SET and TYPES rather than the LLM text: the text is not
a contract, but the shape is. `agent_name` is asserted exactly, because
static/js/main.js:139 round-trips it as a selector.

Health & Wellness, Technical Support, and Research were removed from the live
application (src/config/agents/*.yaml deleted) -- General Support is the only
LLM-type named agent left. Research was also the ONLY agent configured with
`tools:`, so the tool-loop tests that used to run against it (bound-tool
ordering, the tool-calling loop, its 3-iteration bound, tool results fed back
to the model) have no remaining subject in the live app and are removed here,
not adapted -- there is currently no tool-using agent left to characterise.
