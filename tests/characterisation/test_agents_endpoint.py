"""Item 1 -- GET /api/agents.

No LLM is involved, so this response is fully deterministic and is goldened in
its entirety. It is the strongest fixture in the suite: it pins the display
names, the descriptions and the ordering that module 3.8 must reproduce
byte-for-byte when the four hardcoded agents become YAML.

Health & Wellness, Technical Support, and Research were later removed from
the live application; the full registry is now Record Stories, Capture
Discussion, and General Support (in that sort_order). AGENT_NAMES (conftest)
only covers the LLM-type agents used for chat-behavior tests, so the
full-registry order used here is defined locally instead.
