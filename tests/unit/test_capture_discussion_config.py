"""Pins the settings that matter in src/config/agents/capture_discussion.yaml.

The sibling file test_record_stories_config.py explains why this is necessary:
RemoteSpec, RoutingSpec, LimitsSpec and FeaturesSpec do NOT set
extra="forbid" (only BaseAgentSpec does -- verified in src/domain/agent_spec.py),
so a typo'd field name inside `remote:`, `routing:` or `limits:` is silently
dropped rather than rejected at config-sync time. Until now this agent had only
two of its fields asserted anywhere, while its sibling had ten.

    This agent used to sit on v2 (which does work -- 'guest-discussion' IS
    registered in Mitra's Flow table, so the bot resolves and the call returns
    200 with a story id). The endpoint choice is not about bot resolution here,
    it is about which PDF renderer runs:

      v1  create_story_object: flow == GuestDiscussion -> save_chaupal_report
          -> save_shikshalokam_story -> get_story_html -> get_mom_report_html

          -> save_project_story -> get_html_from_template, which returns ""
          when no PDFTemplates row matches the flow, and save_project_story
          hands that "" to Gotenberg.

    Gotenberg renders empty HTML as an empty page and returns 200, so the story
    was created, a StoryMedia row existed, get-story returned 200 and the file
    downloaded fine -- completely blank, with nothing logged. Every signal the
    app could check was green.

    finalize_as_guest belongs in the same pin: Mitra sets
    `auth = access_token is not None` and picks the template's user_type from
    it, so presenting a token on this guest flow misses a GUEST-typed template
    and lands in the same empty-string branch. Mitra's own client for this flow
    posts `access_token: null` (storyPostSessionService._callEndStory), and
    MitraChannel._authenticate already sends `access_token: None` on the
    socket -- finalising as an authenticated user contradicted both.

    Do not move either half back without the other, and not at all without a
    Mitra-side PDFTemplates row for guest-discussion plus a downloaded,
    text-checked PDF (scripts/verify_discussion_report.py) to prove it.
