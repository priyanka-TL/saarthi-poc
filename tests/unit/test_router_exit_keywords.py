"""Exit-keyword matching -- the guard on RouterService Gate 1 / Gate 2.

TWO distinct regressions are pinned here.

1. `_COMMAND_PUNCTUATION` was referenced by `_normalise_command` but defined
   nowhere in the module, so `_is_exit` raised NameError. Gate 2 runs it on
   every turn of a pinned conversation where the client sent no `agent_key` --
   i.e. every turn after a browser refresh or a resume from history -- so
   /api/chat returned HTTP 500 INTERNAL for the whole rest of the interview.

2. Before that, `_is_exit` was a SUBSTRING test, and the bare RoutingSpec
   defaults are ["/exit", "cancel", "stop"]. Ordinary interview answers
   silently aborted the interview: the session was abandoned, the conversation
   unpinned, and the default agent answered plausibly, so the user had no idea
   their discussion would never produce a report. The three FALSE_POSITIVES
   below are real messages taken from the live database (conversation
   836a4305-cfa7-4cbd-8917-ee686ec31511 and its siblings, all abandoned with
   error='user_exit' at step 1).
