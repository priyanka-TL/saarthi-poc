"""MitraChannel -- one socket, one daemon reader thread, one bounded frame queue.

Implements the connection lifecycle described in the design doc (§7.3,
§1.1): connect with the Origin/User-Agent Mitra gates on, send the
`authenticate` frame, then settle for `handshake.settle_ms` WITHOUT waiting
for an acknowledgement -- verified (§1.1) that Mitra never sends one on any
path. `send_and_await_turn` accumulates chunked bot replies (§1.3), discards
the user-echo frame Mitra sends back before dispatching the real reply
(§1.2), and falls back to whatever was accumulated so far when fragments
stop arriving (the idle-gap backstop), rather than hanging until the full
turn timeout.

Deliberately NOT part of this module: MitraSessionManager (the
conversation_id -> MitraChannel LRU map, design doc §7.4). That's a
separate class with its own re-authentication/eviction concerns.
