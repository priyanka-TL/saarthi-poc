"""Reconciling a lost turn against Mitra's own record -- WITHOUT re-sending it.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
When ``send_and_await_turn`` gives up, the turn has NOT necessarily failed.
Verified live (session ``q6geuug...``): Mitra answered in 8.4s, Saarthi stopped
listening, and the reply was simply never read. Two things then went wrong:

  1. ``MitraChannel._drain_stale()`` discards the late frame at the start of the
     next turn, so the answer is lost even if the user does nothing.
  2. The UI's Retry button re-POSTed the same text. Mitra had already moved on,
     so the answer was recorded against the NEXT question -- the §1.6
     answer-destruction hazard the codebase warns about.

So recovery must be READ-ONLY against Mitra. This module holds the decision:
given Mitra's own CompanyChat tail, did our turn land, and did it get answered?

WHY THERE IS NO STORED CURSOR
=============================
The obvious design records the highest CompanyChat id before each send. That
costs a REST round-trip on EVERY turn to learn an id we almost never need, and
the write would have to land before ``handle_turn``'s step-9 commit, i.e. in the
hot path. Instead we match on the last USER row, which needs nothing persisted:
Mitra merges consecutive same-sender messages (common_chat_tasks.py:32-45), so a
repeated answer cannot produce two adjacent user rows to confuse the match.
